## M-Net: MRI Brain Tumor Sequential Segmentation Network via Mesh-Cast

Considered for ICCV 2025

This repository contains the official PyTorch implementation of M-Net, a mesh-cast based sequential segmentation framework for medical image segmentation, proposed in our ICCV 2025 submission.

M-Net models inter-slice dependencies in 2D medical image segmentation by introducing a sequence-aware propagation mechanism, enabling effective contextual aggregation without relying on full 3D convolutions. The framework is particularly designed for volumetric medical images such as brain MRI.

# 🔧 Environment
	•	Python ≥ 3.8
	just like VMamba, if you have already solved that, you can also run us.

# Create environment

conda create -n mnet python=3.8
conda activate mnet
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 📊 Dataset Preparation
Using data_processing to prepare the 2D image (for shuffled), and sequence image (for ordered).
If you don't want to use TPS strategy, you can also use 2D/sequence dataset only. M-Net will treat them to sequence input.


# 🚀 Training

Training is performed using module-based execution, which is required for relative imports.

cd M-Net_code

TPS first
python -m run.train_firstTPS_shuffled \
  --name M_Net_Mamba \
  --dataset_path /path/to/DatasetRoot \
  --batch-size 15 \
  --gpu_device 0

TPS second (will load the checkpoint after TPS first)
python -m run.train_secondTPS_ordered \
  --name M_Net_Mamba \
  --dataset_path /path/to/DatasetRoot \
  --batch-size 15 \
  --gpu_device 0
Key arguments

All experiment configurations are automatically saved to:

checkpoint/{name}/args.pkl
checkpoint/{name}/args.txt



# 🧪 Testing / Evaluation

To evaluate a trained model:

python -m run.test2 \
  --name M_Net_Mamba \
  --gpu_device 0

Outputs are saved to:

checkpoint/{name}/
├── image/
├── mask/
├── result/
└── testlogall_new.csv


# 📈 Metrics

The following metrics are reported:
	•	Dice Score (WT / TC / ET)
	•	Intersection over Union (IoU)
	•	Sensitivity
	•	Positive Predictive Value (PPV)
	•	Hausdorff Distance (HD)

All metrics are computed slice-wise and aggregated sequence-wise, following the evaluation protocol described in the paper.

# 🧠 Notes
	•	This implementation does not rely on 3D convolutions.
	•	Sequential context is modeled via mesh-cast propagation, allowing any sequence model. Just like in model, we give the lstm, convlstm, transformer, xlstm and mamba
	•	The framework is compatible with standard 2D medical segmentation pipelines.
